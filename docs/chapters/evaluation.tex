\section{Performance of SpLATS}
  \subsection{Minimum Requirements}
    \begin{tabular}{| c | p{\colwidth} |}
    \hline
    \textbf{Aim} & \textbf{Progress} \\
    \hline
    Find out if two versions of my code have the same functionality. &
    SpLATS automatically performs regression testing on a code base. \\
    \hline
    Set configuration options to select which classes and/or methods to test. &
    This requirement makes no sense in lieu of Lightweight Ruby (each file is considered a class, and the methods are loaded at run-time). \\
    \hline
    Inspect code coverage of generated tests. &
    Code coverage is automatically given to the user in a nice format when SpLATS has finished running. \\
    \hline
    Reproduce tests. &
    SpLATS behaves in a deterministic way, so the same traversal method with the same options will produce the same output. Even when random is chosen as the traversal method, there is a seed that can be used to create the same tests. \\
    \hline
    Use a command line interface to interact with the system &
    A fully functioning CLI has been written. \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \subsection{Extensions}
    \begin{tabular}{| c | p{\colwidth} | p{\colwidth} |}
    \hline
    \textbf{Aim} & \textbf{Progress} \\
    \hline
    Use a graphical interface to interact with the system &
    A fully functional GUI has been written which displays graphs to the user. \\
    \hline
    Automatically run regression tests on two versions of the code under version control. &
    We can use the standard Git tools to achieve this result. (Git bisect) \\
    \hline
    Test basic program semantics &
    We haven't considered this as we could find no reliable easily-accessible documentation for contracts which are always guaranteed to hold. \\
    \hline
    Test my code across multiple computers at once &
    We haven't considered this, although it would have been useful for the evaluation section for tests with large amounts of branches. \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \subsection{Future Enhancements}
    This table has been modified to reflect future enhancements that we have considered as the project has progressed.
    \begin{tabular}{| c | p{\colwidth} | p{\colwidth} |}
    \hline
    \textbf{Aim} & \textbf{Progress} \\
    \hline
    Use a website to interact with the testing &
    We haven't considered this as the GUI proved to be more challenging.
    \hline
    Have additional options to generate the tests, for example breadth-first and random-directed &
    We have implemented this fully. \\
    \hline
    Better traversal and pruning methods &
    This would be useful to generate tests quicker without using so much memory. \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}

  \subsection{Evaluation of Quality of Generated Tests}
    Several sample CUTs are used to evaluate and test the quality of SpLATS'
test generation. We will also compare the ability of the depth-limited search to
reach full coverage to the random traversal strategy.

    The test classes used were:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Addition - 1 plus the argument, used to test Ruby's arithmetic
internals
      \item SimpleTest - Tests arbitrary methods called upon arguments to the
function, branches based upon the result of the method call
      \item LinkedList - A standard LinkedList implementation, uses both
iterative and recursive algorithms
      \item QuickSort - A recursive quick sort implementation
      \item ISBN-Tools - An open-source library to check the validity of ISBN
numbers, makes heavy use of regular expressions and string methods
    \end{itemize}

  \subsubsection{Result}

    \begin{tabular}{|l|cccc|}
\hline
\textbf{CUT} & \textbf{Search Depth (Mock Depth)} & \textbf{Generation Time/m:s} & \textbf{Tests} & \textbf{Coverage} \\
\hline
Addition & 2 & 0:0.051 & 6 & 3/3 (100\%) \\
\hline
SimpleTest & 2 & 0:0.064 & 32 & 12/12 (100\%) \\
\hline
LinkedList & 2 & 0:0.056 & 31 & 35/47 (74\%) \\
& 3 & 0:0.147 & 306 & 45/47 (96\%) \\
& 4 & 0:2.118 & 3859 & 46/47 (98\%)\\
\hline
QuickSort & 2 (1) & 0:0.344 & 87 & 8/8 (100\%) \\
& 2 (2) & 0:3.356 & 4272 & 8/8 (100\%) \\
& 2 (3) & 5:57.2 & 351927 & Not testable\\
\hline
ISBN-Tools & 2 (1) & 0:0.056 & 13 & 10/16 (63\%) \\
& 2 (2) & 0:0.072 & 57 & 10/16 (63\%) \\
& 2 (3) & Stopped after 30:00 & 341472 & Not testable \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection{Analysis}
  The more successful test cases in the sample set were the ones which did not create large chains of calls on Mock objects.
