\chapter{Introduction}
This report is the presentation of the third year group project, which we named SpLATS Lazy Automated Test System (SpLATS).

The aim of this project is to automatically perform regression testing for Ruby.
Regression testing is where two versions of the same piece of software are checked to confirm they still perform the same function.
The project is aimed at Ruby developers.

The original proposal for the project can be found on Susan Eisenbach's homepage.
