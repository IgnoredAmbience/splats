\chapter{Introduction}

This report is the presentation of the third year group project, SpLATS Lazy Automated Test System (SpLATS).

The aim of this project is to automatically generate regression tests\footnote{Testing to confirm two versions of a piece of code are functionally the same} for Ruby programs.
It is intended for Ruby developers, to aid development by removing the need to such tests by hand.

The original proposal for the project can be found on CATE\footnote{\url{https://cate.doc.ic.ac.uk/projects/proposals.cgi?key=2011:1:show-2147}}.
