\subsection{Meeting Styles}
We started with the aim of having regular, daily meetings, in the style of scrum.
However, conflicting timetables lead to these quickly falling apart, as, between us, we covered all but one lecture series, and thus finding times when we were all available was difficult.

We eventually settled on a single weekly meet with our supervisors, and two group meetings a week, one before the supervisor one.

We also found, later on, that a project IRC channel was helpful.


\section{Development Methods}

\subsection{Working Styles}
We tried a number of styles, including individual and pair work, and a long group hack session.

The hack session worked best.
Should have done more of them.
Damnit.

\subsection{Tools Used}
Git was a great success!

\subsection{Code Style Guidelines}
\begin{itemize}
\item Standard Ruby naming conventions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ethel}
Fiddly bits around the edges.

First started with writing the output module, to turn symbolic tests to actual ruby code to be run later.

Wrote the bulk of the command-line interface.

Also tweaked and documented various other bits of code.
