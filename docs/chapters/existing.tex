\chapter{Existing Products}

There are a number of existing products which perform sub-tasks of what SpLATS offers, but none of them offer a complete solution for automatic testing of Ruby code. Some of the existing products have become integral to SpLATS and others have offered ideas.

\section{Test Frameworks}

  \subsection{Test::Unit}
    The Ruby standard library includes this
module\footnote{\url{http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.2/libdoc/test/unit/rdoc/Test/Unit.html}}
which is a testing framework.

Many other competing testing frameworks exist, most providing little added
benefit other than syntactical differences.

SpLATS targets Test::Unit as its output format.

\section{Static Analysis}

  Static analysis is a form of code analysis performed without actually executing the code itself.

  \subsection{KLEE}
    KLEE\footnote{\url{http://klee.llvm.org}}

\section{Dynamic Analysis} 

  Dynamic analysis is where the code is analyzed as it is executed in some way.

  \subsection{ZenTest}
    ZenTest\footnote{\url{http://docs.seattlerb.org/ZenTest/index.html}}
comprises of a suite of 4 tools designed to assist a software developer with
writing tests for their Ruby code. The tool of particular interest within the suite is itself called ZenTest,
which aims to speed the writing of tests by inspecting the class under test (CUT)
and the test class (TC) for the CUT.

    ZenTest compares the functions defined on the CUT with the methods defined
on the TC. It then produces stub test methods on the TC for those methods on the
CUT it believes are untested.

ZenTest deduces which methods are being tested by analysing the method names; assuming that for every method, \emph{name}, on the CUT there should be a corresponding method on the TC named \texttt{test\_\emph{name}}. This is a very superficial and basic method for determining whether or not a class is completely tested.

    Whilst this tool is extremely useful, it still expects developers to write
the tests themselves. The aim of SpLATS is to focus the attention away from
writing tests, and to allow a developer to just write code.

  \subsection{IRULAN}
    IRULAN\footnote{\url{http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~tora/thesis.pdf}} is an automated blackbox testing system for Haskell written by Dr Allwood as his PhD thesis.
    IRULAN performs directed random testing, which is a different method to how SpLATS performs (see below).

  \subsection{Tickling Java with a Feather}
    This\footnote{\url{http://pubs.doc.ic.ac.uk/testing-Java-with-fj/testing-Java-with-fj.pdf}} is another of Dr Allwood's research papers, where he performs automated testing on a subset of the Java language.
    Some of the methods outlined here are useful.

  \subsection{Randoop}
    Randoop\footnote{\url{http://code.google.com/p/randoop/}} is another
feedback-directed random testing framework for Java.

    It generates a progressively growing sequence of method calls, which are
then executed and checked to see if the result is useful, redundant, illegal or
contract-violating. The test is then reused as a seed if determined to be
useful.

    Contract-violating test cases are also output as a means of highlighting
that the CUT violates a semantic rule. The standard contracts are derived from
the Java Language Specification. Further contracts can be added to the system by
the user.

    It has been used to find errors in a number of commonly used libraries.

  \subsection{RuTeG}
    RuTeG\footnote{S. Mairhofer, R. Feldt, R. Torkar, Search-based software
testing and Test Data Generation for a Dynamic Programming Language} (Ruby Test
case Generator) is a project with similar aims to SpLATS, but approaches the
problem from a slightly different angle.

RuTeG attempts to find the appropriate type of variable to pass into the CUT
methods by using a "selecting data generator" for each argument. This selection
forms a part of the search space of the test generation, which is directed using
a genetic algorithm.

RuTeG was successful in its aims to achieve higher-level coverage at a faster
rate than a random search method.
