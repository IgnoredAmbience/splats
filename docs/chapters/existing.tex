\chapter{The State of the Art}

  There are a number of existing products that perform similar tasks, using a variety of approaches, for a variety of areas.

\section{Test Frameworks}

  \subsection{Test::Unit}
    The Ruby standard library includes this
module\footnote{\url{http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.2/libdoc/test/unit/rdoc/Test/Unit.html}}
which offers to programmers the framework on which test suites can be written
and executed.

Many other competing testing frameworks exist, most providing little added
benefit other than syntactical differences.

SpLATS targets Test::Unit as its output format.

\section{Static Analysis}

  \subsection{KLEE}

\section{Dynamic Analysis} 

  \subsection{ZenTest}
    ZenTest\footnote{\url{http://docs.seattlerb.org/ZenTest/index.html}}
comprises of a suite of 4 tools designed to assist a software developer with
writing tests for their Ruby code. The tool of particular interest within the suite is itself called ZenTest,
it aims to speed the writing of tests by inspecting the class under test (CUT)
and the test class (TC) for the CUT.

    ZenTest compares the functions defined on the CUT with the methods defined
on the TC. It then produces stub test methods on the TC for those methods on the
CUT it believes are untested.

    The deduction of which methods are being tested is performed by analysing
the method names, ZenTest assumes that for every method, \emph{name}, on the
CUT, then there should be a corresponding test method on the TC will be named
with a prefix of \texttt{test\_\emph{name}}. This is a very superficial and
basic method for determining whether a class is fully tested.

    Whilst this tool is extremely useful, it still expects developers to write
the tests themselves. The aim of SpLATS is to focus the attention away from
writing tests, and to allow a developer to just code.

  \subsection{IRULAN}
    IRULAN\footnote{\url{http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~tora/thesis.pdf}} is an automated blackbox testing system for Haskell written by Dr Allwood as his PhD thesis.
    IRULAN performs directed random testing, which is a different method to how SpLATS performs (see below).

  \subsection{Tickling Java with a Feather}
    This\footnote{\url{http://pubs.doc.ic.ac.uk/testing-Java-with-fj/testing-Java-with-fj.pdf}} is another of Dr Allwood's research papers, where he performs automated testing on a subset of the Java language.
    Some of the methods outlined here are useful.

  \subsection{Randoop}
    Randoop\footnote{\url{http://code.google.com/p/randoop/}} is another directed random testing framework, like IRULAN, but for Java.
    It generates a progressively growing sequence of method calls, before running standard tests (eg, \verb|o.equals(o)|).
    It has been used to find errors in a number of commonly used libraries.
